✅ Instruction:

“Always write commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification, and ensure that each commit message (including type, scope, and description) does not exceed 100 characters in total.”

⸻

📌 Example Prompt Summary:

If you’re using this in a system (like a custom CLI, LLM workflow, or commit hook), here’s a more system-friendly version:

Use Conventional Commits format (e.g., feat, fix, chore, etc.), and limit commit message to 100 characters max, including type, optional scope, and description.



⸻

💡 Optional reinforcement:

If you want to be extra specific, you can include examples:

Format: <type>(<scope>): <description> — max 100 chars

Examples:
- feat(auth): add login with Google
- fix(user): prevent crash when email is missing
